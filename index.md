There's a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FyRUyQG).

The source code for my terraria mods is [here](https://github.com/Tyfyter) in case you want to see how something works;

[here](https://forms.gle/1zA8JDKQNZMJoRFy8)'s a form for feedback and such;

And [here](https://tyfyter.github.io/search) is a helpful search page for song lyrics and tML's ExampleMod.

That's about it.
