## Welcome to my poorly set up GitHub Page

There's a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FyRUyQG).

The source code for my terraria mods is [here](https://github.com/Tyfyter) in case you want to see how something works.

And [here](https://forms.gle/1zA8JDKQNZMJoRFy8)'s a form for feedback and such.

I also made a [standolone minecraft 1.9 mod](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qvj669mifp6w74b/AAD90qoiGZYzpxo_ZWO1tV42a?dl=0).

That's about it.
